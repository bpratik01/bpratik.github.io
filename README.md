## About Me
I'm a final-year B.Tech student in Robotics and AI, passionate about using machine learning to solve real-world problems. With a solid understanding of ML algorithms and hands-on experience with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch, I'm always eager to learn and grow.

Lately, I've been delving into MLOps, experimenting with tools like DVC and MLflow to streamline model deployment. My goal is to bridge the gap between development and production, making ML solutions more scalable and reliable.
